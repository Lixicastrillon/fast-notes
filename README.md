 # **TO DO LIST** 📝
A space will be created to create homework.

## **📌 GOALS**

- Create a home page that displays a list of tasks:

1. Add tasks: It should be possible to add new tasks to the list
from a text input field and an "Add" button.
2. Delete Tasks: Users must be able to delete tasks
individually by clicking a button next to each task.
3. Validations: validate that empty tasks cannot be added.
