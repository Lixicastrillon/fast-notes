 # **TO DO LIST** 📝
A space will be created to create tasks with a level of significance so that their development is orderly and optimal.

## **📌 OBJETIVOS**

- Create a home page that displays a list of tasks:

1. Add tasks: It should be possible to add new tasks to the list
from a text input field and an "Add" button.
2. Delete Tasks: Users must be able to delete tasks
individually by clicking a button next to each task.
3. Validations: validate that empty tasks cannot be added.


# ToDoList

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
